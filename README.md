## **ARTICLE I – Name**

<a name="a1s1"/>

**Section I –** The name of this organization shall be Ryerson Community Theatre (hereby referred to as RCT).

<a name="a2"/>

## **ARTICLE II – Mission Statement**

<a name="a2s1"/>

**Section I –** The purpose of this organization is to support and develop theatre and the dramatic arts in the Ryerson Community.

<a name="a2s2"/>

**Section II –** RCT will abide by all Ryerson University and Oakham House policies and procedures.

<a name="a3"/>

## **ARTICLE III – Artistic Vision**

<a name="a3s1"/>

**Section I –** Both RCT and the events it both supports and organizes will pursue both artistry and entertainment. RCT&#39;s goal is to explore theatre that has both entertainment value and artistic depth. As a student group, RCT has the unique opportunity to explore unconventional and challenging theatrical productions. It should always attempt to take advantage of this opportunity.

<a name="a3s2"/>

**Section II –** While RCT will always consider any production, regardless of content, some or all of the following guidelines will apply when evaluating a prospective or ongoing production:

1. Violent, graphic, and/or disturbing content will only be accepted if the director/writer/actor/producer/stage manager (collectively referred to as the Producers) can provide artistic justification (shock value, especially if it does not contribute to a coherent theme or message, is not an acceptable justification).
2. A prospective or ongoing production can only be rejected or dropped from the roster for the above reason if a significant majority ([defined in Article VI](#a6)) of RCT members on the editorial or assessment board feel that the Producers have not provided acceptable justification.
3. A prospective or ongoing production can only be accepted, rejected, or dropped from the roster if a significant majority of RCT members on the editorial or assessment board feel that its quality is unacceptable.
4. In the previous two cases, if a significant majority is not present, the Artistic Director will make the final decision.

<a name="a3s3"/>

**Section III** – While the writers of original plays that have been accepted by RCT retain the rights to their work, RCT reserves the right to use their pieces for educational purposes at any time without permission such as in educational workshops and scene studies. Being a not-for-profit, RCT may perform this work at any time, however, if RCT is interested in performing a writer&#39;s work, they will make every reasonable attempt to get in touch, and will not proceed unless the original writer in question has not responded within 7 full days. If the writer explicitly refuses within this time period, RCT will not perform the play. RCT may only perform any of the original pieces without permission as long the performance is not-for-profit. This right does not extend to publication or distribution of the work of RCT playwrights.  Of course, this constitution is not a legally binding document, but it is hoped that any writer for RCT will be magnanimous enough to volunteer their work for the betterment of the Ryerson Community.

<a name="a4"/>

## **Article IV – Activities and Scope**

<a name="a4s1"/>

**Section I –** Each season (hereby defined as starting in September and ending by July), RCT must put on a production showcasing a series of plays produced by members of the Ryerson Community. While the plays must be directed by, produced by, and acted by members of the Ryerson Community, they do not necessarily have to be written by them. However, when evaluating applications for performances to be showcased in the end-of-year production, new plays written by community members ([defined in Article V, Section I](#a5s1)) will be prioritized.

<a name="a4s2"/>

**Section II** – RCT is not limited to the end-of-year production. RCT encourages people from within and without RCT&#39;s formal membership to contribute ideas, suggestions, and proposals for new events. Some events that RCT have sponsored or held in the past are:

1. Scene Studies/Acting Workshops
2. Fundraisers/Pub Nights
3. Recruitment Events

<a name="a5"/>

## **Article V – Membership Requirements**

<a name="a5s1"/>

**Section I –** General membership has only one requirement - that the applicant be interested in building theatre and the dramatic arts in the Ryerson Community. Once an applicant has attended an RCT event, such as a scene study, pub night, or end-of-year show, they are considered a member of RCT and will be treated with the respect and consideration that entails.

<a name="a5s2"/>

**Section II -** A formal member (able to vote in the event of a general election for executive appointment which is not, at this time, how RCT appoints members - [see Article VI, Section IV](#a6s4)) of RCT must have either attended the majority of or contributed greatly to RCT events (such as the scene studies/acting workshops). As well, a member is considered formal if they have acted as a Producer in a play or made a major contribution in some other way (Front-of-House, Backstage Crew, Technical Staff, Graphic Design, etc.)

<a name="a5s3"/>

**Section III** – A person may be black-listed (barred) from attending RCT events or acting as a Producer at any time. However, in order to do so, a significant majority of members on the Executive Board must be in agreement. In the event that no significant majority exists, the Artistic Director has final say.

1. The black-listed person must be informed of their black-list status
2. A person may not be black-listed for more than one season without review
3. All executive members ([defined in Article VI](#a6)) must be informed of members who are blacklisted or were blacklisted for the last season.
4. RCT&#39;s Executive Board may not intentionally withhold information about an ex-member&#39;s blacklisting if it is requested by any member, formal or otherwise, but is not required to volunteer the information

<a name="a6"/>

## **Article VI – Executive Board**

<a name="a6s1"/>

**Section I –** Executive board members are decomposed into two sub-classes, each with distinct responsibilities and requirements for eligibility.

1. _Executive-At-Large_ – An applicant is only eligible for consideration if they are a formal member of RCT. Executives-at-Large are executives operating on the Executive Board and within the power structure of RCT without formal titles or responsibilities. However, Executives-at-Large are the hands, eyes, ears, and sometimes legs of the group. The executives-at-large work closely with the General Manager to realize events, though of course they may work with the Artistic Director and Treasurer as well. Executives-at-Large are encouraged and expected to either come up with or help write at least one event proposal in coordination with the Artistic Director, partly to help train new executives for leadership in subsequent years, but mostly to enrich the community as a whole with varied events.  Executives-at-Large will attend meetings, help procure properties and resources, and provide input. Executives-at-Large will not be expected to provide input on or make major decisions, but their input is always appreciated.

	1. _Informal Titles -_ Depending on the strengths and weaknesses of an executive-at-large, a number of informal titles may be assigned. These titles may be rotated throughout the executives-at-large, or may be dissolved at any time throughout the year. These informal titles are opportunities for executives-at-large to develop their skills and lead or further the group&#39;s interests. Some informal titles include, but are not limited to –

		* _Events Coordinator_
		* _Social Coordinator_
		* _Graphic Designer_
		* _Advertising Head_
		* _Properties Manager_
		* _Front-of-House Manager_
		* _Secretary_
		* _HR/Conflict Resolution Head_

		If an executive-at-large shows great interest and/or aptitude at any of these roles, they may be assigned them for the duration of the season.

		Executives-at-large broadly get to choose their level of involvement, but a basic level of commitment and competence is required by all members.

2. _Named Executives –_ There are three formal named positions on the RCT Executive Board. An applicant is only eligible for a named position if they have been an Executive-At-Large for one full season. Though more named positions may be added in future, only three must exist at all times in the general case. In the event that there are not enough eligible members to fill all three roles, or the members that are eligible are not interested, one or all of these roles can be combined or shared. This combination of roles does not impart any additional voting power.

	1. **Artistic Director** - The Artistic Director is responsible for the guidance and direction of the group. The Artistic Director **must** have a clear vision on where s/he would like to take this group. In more practical terms, the Artistic Director is responsible for **overall planning**. The Artistic Director will write detailed event proposals, covering every aspect of the event, and will make final decisions on matters. During play submission review, the Artistic Director will lead the decision-making process. While the Artistic Director has final say in what should happen in the group, this only matters when there is no consensus. The Artistic Director should not need to be making final decisions if there is already a majority.

	2. **General Manager**- The General Manager is responsible for executing and procuring the requirements detailed in the Artistic Director&#39;s event proposals. The General Manager will set deadlines, do check-ups, and utilize the executives-at-large (and other resources of RCT) to accomplish the goals set by the Artistic Director. The General Manager must ensure that deadlines are being met. The General Manager may act as Artistic Director (and vice-versa) if the Artistic Director is absent or unavailable.

	3. **Treasurer** - The Treasurer is responsible for being the point-of-contact with Oakham&#39;s financial department, approving and keeping track of any and all expenditures and incomes in RCT. The Treasurer will draft budgets, requisition funds, reimburse anyone who makes approved purchases for the group, and keep up-to-date with any other financial matters.

3. A new named role may only be added if the General Manager, Artistic Director, and Treasurer are in agreement that it is necessary, even if a majority exists in the board as a whole.

<a name="a6s2"/>

**Section II -** Approving and assessing plays will be done by the Editorial Board and Assessment Board, respectively. No RCT executive board member may be barred from serving on either or all of these boards.

<a name="a6s3"/>

**Section III –** Any eligible candidate may apply for a position, but the specific details of the application process will be left to the current season&#39;s executive team to decide. The decision to approve or reject an executive appointment will be determined by a majority vote within the current season&#39;s executive team, with the following regulations:

1. If there is only one eligible candidate, that candidate does not require a majority vote to be appointed.
2. Retiring members of the current season&#39;s executive team should be given every opportunity to participate in considering prospective candidates, but are not allowed to vote on any application.
3. If a member of the current season&#39;s executive team is applying for a position, the other remaining members will vote on their appointment. The member applying may not vote on their own application.
4. In the case of a tie between remaining executive members, a retiring member may cast the tie-breaking vote. In the case of multiple retiring members, if any of the retiring members is a named executive in the current season, they will cast the tie-breaking vote. If multiple named executives are retiring, the tie-breaking voter will be chosen in this order – Artistic Director, General Manager, Treasurer.
5. In the case that all current season executives are retiring, each executive member will be treated as not retiring for the duration of the appointment process, and all typical decision making rules apply. In other words, there must be a majority vote among current season&#39;s executives in order to approve an appointment.

<a name="a6s4"/>

**Section IV –** In the past, elections and campaigning have been proposed for determining board members. At the time of writing, RCT feels that electing executive members onto the RCT board without proven experience is unwise, unfair, and a waste of time and resources - elections favor members that have been involved in larger productions (naturally, larger productions have more formal members, which results in more votes). However, in the event of an election, the rules are as follows:

1. Only formal members and executives ([defined in Article V](#a5)) are allowed to vote
2. Formal members may only run for an Executive-At-Large position
3. Only Executives-At-Large and current Named Executives may run for a named position, though either can run for an Executive-At-Large position
4. All campaigners have access to the same amount of funding and support. A campaigner may not spend their own money to support their campaign. The amount of funding released for campaigning will be determined by Oakham&#39;s Financial Director
5. In the event that a campaigner breaks the above rule, s/he will be disqualified immediately.
6. In the event that a campaigner has not handed in all of the receipts of his/her purchases (one copy to Oakham, one to whichever public forum is most representative of the general RCT membership) 48 hours before the voting date, s/he will be disqualified immediately. Note: all credit card, debit card, and other financially sensitive information must be blacked out (for personal security).
7. In the event that a campaigner has more material (posters, pamphlets, music, etc.,) than is accounted for in their receipts, s/he will be disqualified immediately.
	1. If the campaigner has sufficient proof that foul play is uncertain, but insufficient proof to outright disprove it, elections will be suspended until either the campaigner or the accuser(s) can provide sufficient proof to either confirm or deny the accusation. If neither party provides sufficient proof, decisions will favor the campaigner.
	2. In the event that either the campaigner or accuser are proven wrong, a public statement will be released by RCT stating the results of the accusation and the names of everyone involved.
	3. Sufficient proof will be determined by Oakham&#39;s Financial Director.
8. In the event that a campaigner is disqualified, RCT&#39;s Current Executive Board may not withhold the information or refrain from posting it publicly when requested, but is not required to volunteer the information or voluntarily post it publicly.

<a name="a6s5"/>

**Section V –** If any executive member, named or otherwise, has a complaint regarding the professional conduct, fulfillment of duty, or competence of another member, they have the right to and are encouraged to initiate a dialogue of complaint. A dialogue of complaint is subject to the following rules –

1. A dialogue is not assumed to be a dialogue of complaint until specified by the complainant.
2. It should be explicitly understood that a dialogue of complaint is a healthy and important process for the group to go forward, and should be considered by all to be in the interests of the group at large.
3. A dialogue of complaint may only be initiated in regards to the professional conduct, fulfillment of duty, or competence of an executive member.
4. Explicitly, a dialogue of complaint cannot be and should be understood as not being an arena for personal complaints.
5. A dialogue of complaint may take place in person, online, or otherwise, and does not require all members to proceed; however, members relevant to the complaint must be in attendance. Any executive member, named or otherwise, may attach a dialogue of complaint to a meeting agenda&#39;s Decisions ([defined in Article VII](#a7)) without needing to specify the subject or subjects of his or her complaint.
6. When a dialogue of complaint has been declared by a complainant, the complainant will then be given the chance to fully articulate his or her complaint. It is expected that respect and silence will be afforded to the complainant during this time.
7. After the complainant has completed his or her articulation, the executive member at whom the complaint was articulated will be given a chance to respond to this complaint. Once again, it is expected that respect and silence will be given to the speaker during this time.
8. In the event that any executive member is not affording either the complainant or the complained against silence during their respective articulations, that executive member will be silenced for the duration of that articulation.
9. Finally, each executive member present must then give their opinion on the subject of the dialogue. Executive members who are not present but are able to review the dialogue (if it happens to be recorded) are encouraged to provide their input as well. Once again, it should be understood by all readers that opinions are given honestly, in the hope of furthering the group and ensuring a healthy and productive environment.
10. A dialogue of complaint has no formal ending, and may continue until all members are satisfied or until the dialogue comes to a natural close throughout the course of a meeting, conversation, or otherwise.

<a name="a6s6"/>

**Section VI –** If a general member has a complaint regarding the professional conduct, fulfillment of duty, or competence of an executive member, they may, and are encouraged to, issue a written complaint to any member of the executive board. In the event that a complaint is issued, the following events must occur and be documented in a way that can be provided upon request by Oakham or by any of the involved parties-

1. The complaint must be read by all members of the executive board.
2. Each member of the executive board must provide his or her opinion on the complaint.
3. A solution must be developed by the board and presented to the complainant -
	1. Solutions may be, but are not limited to, public or non-public written or verbal apologies, public or non-public declarations of change of conduct, and/or public or non-public suspension or removal from the executive board.
	2. Solutions will only be approved if a significant majority of the board agrees that the solution is adequate.
4. If the complainant is unsatisfied with the solution presented by the board, they may call a complaint meeting which is subject to the following rules –
	1. The executive member(s) at whom the complaint is issued must be present at the meeting in the general case. If the complainant wishes, the executive member(s) at whom the complaint is issued may be barred from attending.
	2. A formal complaint meeting must be recorded in its entirety with no less than one camera with microphone, capturing both the members of the board and the complainant. In the case of technical failure, the meeting will be suspended until recording can be restored. Any decisions, comments, or dialogue made while recording devices are malfunctioning may not have any impact on the results or discussion of the meeting once recording is restored.
	3. The complainant will begin the meeting by articulating his or her complaint in full. The complainant must be given enough time to fully articulate his or her complaint, to his or her satisfaction. If an executive board member interrupts this articulation without good cause, they will be removed from the meeting until the articulation is complete.
	4. If the executive member(s) at whom the complaint is issued is present, they will then be given the opportunity to fully articulate his or her response to this complaint. If an executive board member or the complainant interrupts this articulation without good cause, they will be removed from the meeting until the articulation is complete. If the executive member(s) at whom the complaint is issued is not present, they must either provide (a) written statement(s) that will be read aloud in full in representation of their articulation or expressly waive their right to articulate.
	5. Once both the complainant and the executive member(s) at whom the complaint was issued have completed their articulations, the executive board and complainant will then collaborate to find some solution that is mutually agreeable to both the complainant and a significant majority of the executive board.
5. In the case that the complainant feels that a satisfactory solution has not been offered and is either unwilling to call or unhappy with the results of a complaint meeting, the complaint will be forwarded to and will fall under the discretion of the Oakham House Director. This must also occur if a mutually agreeable solution cannot be reached during a complaint meeting. If this occurs, any further procedures will be handled by the Oakham House. If requested, RCT must either provide the complainant with confirmation that their complaint has been forwarded to Oakham or assist the complainant in submitting their complaint to Oakham directly.

<a name="a6s7"/>

**Section VII –** An executive member, named or otherwise, may only be removed given the following conditions -

1. The dismissal may only occur after a formal review meeting which only executives may attend.
2. Any executive member may call a formal review meeting for any other executive member.
3. The formal review meeting may only proceed if a majority of executives, including the member-to-be-reviewed, are present
4. Within reasonable limits, the schedules of the member-to-be-reviewed and the reviewing members must be accommodated (they may teleconference).
5. A formal review meeting may not occur during Ryerson&#39;s publicly posted exam or midterm season. In the case of uncertainty, a formal review meeting also may not occur within 72 hours of an exam, midterm, evaluation, or job interview.
6. The member-to-be-reviewed is allowed to vote.
7. The member-to-be-reviewed must be given the opportunity to defend themselves, and has the right to remain uninterrupted for the duration of his/her defense.
8. The defense of the member-to-be-reviewed has 20 minutes to defend themselves, uninterrupted, or in dialogue form until either the formal review meeting has had all expected members present for one and a half hours or the member-to-be-reviewed is satisfied with their defense. If the member-to-be-reviewed has been defending him or herself in dialogue form while all expected members are present for at least one hour and ten minutes, the member-to-be-reviewed may request to proceed uninterrupted, but will be given no more time than if they had chosen to continue defending themselves in dialogue form. In other words, a defense may not exceed 1.5 hours in the general case if all expected members are present, whether through dialogue or a monologue following a dialogue. No other forms of defense are allowed.
9. If the member-to-be-reviewed is interrupted despite expressly stating that they would like to remain uninterrupted, they will be given 5 additional minutes per interruption, even if the defense would then exceed 1.5 hours.
10. Unless the member-to-be-reviewed has expressly requested to remain uninterrupted, the other executive members may silence the member-to-be-reviewed for no more than 2 minutes at a time, and may only invoke this right if the member-to-be-reviewed is maliciously and intentionally trying to interrupt dialogue between reviewing members. A warning must always be given before invoking this right.
11. The vote may not proceed if a majority of members, including the member-to-be-reviewed are not present.
12. The vote may not proceed if a member not present has expressed that they will be attending within one hour of and up to one hour after the meeting start date. If they have expressed previously that they will be late, then the vote may not proceed until one hour after their expected arrival.
13. The member-to-be-reviewed must be present at the formal review meeting during the majority vote. However, if 30 minutes have passed since their expected arrival time, and all other expected members are present, the vote will take place without them.
14. A vote must proceed no more than 15 minutes after the defense is over, and the reviewing members may silence the member-to-be-reviewed for this entire duration.
15. A formal review meeting must be recorded in its entirety with no less than one camera with microphone, capturing both the reviewing members and the member-to-be-reviewed. In the case of technical failure, the meeting will be suspended until recording can be restored. Any decisions, comments, or dialogue made while recording devices are malfunctioning may not be used as a talking point, point of defense, or otherwise have any impact on the results or discussion of the meeting once recording is restored.
16. RCT may not withhold recordings (or otherwise prevent access) from a formal member, an executive member, or a blacklisted ex-member such that they are unable to view a meeting recording (in the case of a blacklisted ex-member, they may only view formal review meetings in which they are a participant or subject), but it is not expected for RCT to volunteer a recording.

## **Article VII – Decision Making Process**

<a name="a7s1"/>

**Section I –** The Treasurer, General Manager, and Artistic Director must be in agreement for an event proposal to be eligible to be approved for action.

<a name="a7s2"/>

**Section II –** An event proposal may only be approved for action after receiving a majority vote at an event proposal meeting.  A meeting cannot be held within 72 hours of the decision to hold it.

<a name="a7s3"/>

**Section III –** Only members that are present at a meeting may vote on the Decisions (defined below) of that meeting. Members may not express their wishes beforehand in place of attendance. If they wish, a member may teleconference, though only in extreme cases.

<a name="a7s4"/>

**Section IV –** The agenda of a meeting must be posted at least 72 hours beforehand. The agenda must consist of Decisions, Topics, and Administration. Decisions are decisions that must be made before the meeting is over. Topics are issues and areas of discussion that should be covered before the meeting is over, but are not necessary to end the meeting. Administration includes any activities that do not require input but concern one or more members of the group (such as handing in receipts). Decisions may be added to a meeting agenda less than 72 hours before the meeting, but any executive who is or would be absent from the meeting must be specifically informed of the added Decision and may choose to either stop the Decision from being added or reopen the Decision for discussion in a subsequent meeting (the absentee member must exercise this right within a week of the minutes of the meeting in question being posted). Decisions made during a meeting are not necessarily final, but they will not be changed or re-opened to discussion without a valid reason.

<a name="a7s5"/>

**Section V –** If a member is more than an hour and a half late from their expected arrival time, or if they choose not to attend, Decisions will be made without them. This is true for any executive member, including Artistic Director or General Manager. As well, Decisions may be made concerning the distribution of responsibilities, and a member may be given responsibilities even if they did not attend the meeting.

<a name="a7s6"/>

**Section VI –** A significant majority is defined as 70% of members in agreement, or the closest percentage. In the event that two percentages are evenly distributed, the higher of the percentages will act as the definition of a significant majority.

1. Unless otherwise specified, the term &#39;majority&#39; should only be interpreted to mean a percentage greater than but not equal to 50%.

<a name="a8"/>

## **Article VIII – Dissolution of Organization**

<a name="a8s1"/>

**Section I –** In the event that RCT completely dissolves, all of its funds and properties will remain with Oakham House. Indeed, all of its funds and properties are already the property of Oakham House.

<a name="a9"/>

## **Article IX – Procedure to Amend the Constitution**

<a name="a9s1"/>

**Section I –** The constitution may only be amended given the following conditions -

1. The constitution may only be amended during a Constitutional Amendment Meeting (hereby referred to as CAM).
2. All formal members must be notified that a CAM is occurring. RCT must extend a public invitation to all formal members.
3. A CAM must be announced at least one week before it occurs.
4. The Artistic Director, General Manager, and Treasurer must be present at the CAM.
5. Within reason, the schedules of all executive members that wish to attend must be accommodated.
6. The CAM cannot occur during exam season. Otherwise, it may occur at any time.
7. Each amendment will only be added if it has a significant majority vote from all formal and executive members present. In the case that a significant majority does not exist, the Artistic Director has the final say.
8. If a member cannot attend a CAM, decisions and amendments will be made without them.
9. During a CAM, any member present may propose an amendment.
